// React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library 
// for building user interfaces.
// compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.

// React Icons -We included react icons to the project for styling.

// React Hooks- This allows us to use state and other react features.

// usestate was used in the project, it allows our functional components
//  which used to be stateless become stateful.

// Advantages:

//  to design some pieces of codes once and use them multiple times(reusable).
//   This has greatly reduced the production time
//    and made debugging less tedious.
//    Using React.js, developers can build individual components in a web-based app 
//    that can be individually coded, rendered, updated, and repeated.

// Base React Interview Questions

// General questions and concepts to prepare for a React-based interview.


// React Logo

// 1. What is React?

// React is a UI (front-end) SPA (single-page application) 
// JavaScript library developed by Facebook in 2011. 
// It is used to build UI components.

// 2. What are some key features of React?

// Using the Virtual DOM instead of the real DOM
// Using server-side rendering
// Following a uni-directional data flow

// 3. Explain what the Virtual DOM is and how it works.

// First, it’s important to understand what 
// the real DOM is — then it’ll be easier to understand 
// the concept of the virtual DOM and why it’s an amazing 
// feature in React.

// The Real DOM

// What it is: DOM stands for Document Object Model.

//  The DOM is an interface that represents a document (like an HTML document or XML document)
//   with a logical tree. In simpler terms, it represents the UI of an application.
// What makes it slow: Every time there is a change to 
// the state of your application, the DOM needs to be updated to reflect that change.
//  With each change, the UI needs to be repainted (re-rendered).
//   This repainting process is slow. This is where the true benefit of the Virtual DOM comes.

// Below is an HTML page:
// <!DOCTYPE html>
// <html lang="en">
//   <head>
//     <meta charset="UTF-8">
//     <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
//     <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
//     <title>New York City</title>
//   </head>
//   <body>
//     <h1>New York City: The 5 Boroughs</h1>
// 	<h2>Brooklyn</h2>
//   </body>
// </html>
// The DOM instance of the HTML page would be like:

// The Virtual DOM
// What it is: Its a lightweight JavaScript object that’s 
// originally just a copy (a virtual representation) of the
//  real DOM.
// How it works:
// Via React, only the # of likes is updated in the screens
//  below when the user clicks the like button, instead of the entire UI being updated.
//   Basically, all other elements are left as-is.

// Step-by-step:
// Whenever any underlying data changes, the entire UI is
//  re-rendered in virtual DOM.

// 2. Then the difference between the previous DOM 
// representation and the new one is calculated.

// 3. Once the calculations are done, the real DOM will be 
// updated with only the things that have actually changed.

// Why its faster: Because there are minimal operations on the real DOM,
//  this makes the re-rendering of the UI much quicker.
 
// 4. What are some key differences between the real DOM and the Virtual DOM?

// Differences between real vs. virtual DOM

// 5. What is JSX?
// JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is a syntax extension 
// to JavaScript that looks a lot like HTML.
// It allows us to easily add HTML to React. Although 
// it is not required to use JSX in React apps, it is standard practice.
// Example using JSX:
// const name = <h1>Ayaan Khan</h1>;

// ReactDOM.render(name, document.getElementById('root'));
// Example without JSX:
// const name = React.createElement('h1', {}, 'Ayaan Khan');

// ReactDOM.render(name, document.getElementById('root'));

// 6. What is Babel?
// Babel is a JavaScript compiler that can translate 
// markup or programming languages into JavaScript.
// Babel is available for different conversions. 
// React uses Babel to convert JSX into JavaScript.

// 7. What is server-side rendering?
// Server-side rendering (SSR) is an application’s 
// ability to convert HTML files on the server into a fully rendered HTML page for the client.
// The web browser submits a request for information 
// from the server, which instantly responds by sending
//  a fully rendered page to the client.
// Diagram how server-side rendering works

// 8. What is a uni-directional data flow?

// Uni-directional data flow is also known as one-way data flow, 
// which means the data has only one way to be transferred 
// to other parts of the application.
// This means that child components are not able to 
// update the data that is coming from the parent components. 
// In React, data coming from a parent is called props.

// 9. What are some benefits of a uni-directional data flow?
// Greater Control: The major benefit of this 
// approach is that data flows throughout your 
// app in a single direction, giving you better 
// control over it.
// Easier Debugging: As you know what data is 
// coming from where.
// Less Error-Prone: As you have more control over the data.
// Greater Efficiency: As the library knows what the 
// boundaries are of each part of the system.

// 10. What is an element in React?

// Elements are the smallest building blocks of React apps. They describe what you want to see on the app.
// Example of an element:
// const element = <h1>Hi, I'm an element!</h1>;

// 11. What is a component in React?
// Components are the building blocks of a 
// React application’s UI. These components split up the 
// entire UI into small independent and reusable pieces. 
// Then, it renders each of these components independent 
// of each other without affecting the rest of the UI.
// Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. 
// They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) 
// and return React elements describing what 
// should appear on the screen.

// 12. What are props?
// props stands for properties. They are like 
// arguments sent to React components.
// Example:
// const myelement = <Car brand="Ford" />;

// The Car component then receives the arguments as props:
// function Car(props) {
//   return <h2>I am a { props.brand }!</h2>;
// }

// comparissson operators 

// == compare values in the variable,not data types.
// === compare data types and values of variables.

var num = "26";

if(num==25){
  return true;
}else{
  return false;
}
